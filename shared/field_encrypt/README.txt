Field Encrypt
-------------

The goal of this module is to create a method for encrypting field values when
stored in the database.

This module depends on the Encrypt module (http://drupal.org/project/encrypt)
for encrypting and decrypting strings.

Install this module like any other module. Field encryption settings are made on
the field edit page.
