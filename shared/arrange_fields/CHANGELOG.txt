Changelog for Arrange Fields
For Drupal 7.x
===================

9-25-2011
 Thanks to user drizzi (http://drupal.org/user/226909) for letting me debug on his server, I discovered the
 solution to an anoying bug affecting several Webforms users.  When you set
 the label to be "inline" in webforms, a strange interaction with CSS and jQuery UI
 caused textfields to resize strangely.  From now on, use Arrange Fields to set the
 label as inline or not.
 
 Also, fixed an issue where sometimes form elements wind up "stacked" on top of each other
 when arranging fields for the first time.
 
 Also fixed a bug where setting radio buttons/checkboxes to inline, then back to block
 caused a problem.

9-24-2011
 Found a bug which was causing certain webform components to not be
 configurable (they didn't get the configure link on the hover handle),
 and they were not being recognized as webform components.

9-22-2011
 Added the ability to specify module include files along with form_id's, 
 on the Arrange Fields settings page.

6-30-2011
 Added support for the Mollom module, when using Webforms (it was not
 arrangable until now)

5-26-2011
 Added a new "Enable form_id discovery mode" checkbox to the settings
 page to make it easier to find out form id's on the page.  If checked,
 administrators will see a printout at the top of every page with a list
 of what forms are on that page. You can then enter those form_id's into
 the settings page to arrange them.

4-17-2011
 Somehow the png graphic for the grid got corrupted, so
 I am replacing it.

3-19-2011
 Made minor change to prevent a notice from showing up when
 arranging a content type (the notice was coming from core's
 node.pages.inc, line 303).

3-16-2011
 Made a minor change when looking at elements in the form array
 to prevent PHP notice messages from appearing.

1-26-2011
 Made a slight change to init a variable before using it. This
 was causing a PHP Notice to appear in certain situations.

01-14-2011
  Tweaking some display issues, and doing my best to get rid
  of PHP notices being generated from this module.  Also, corrected
  some instruction text to be correct for D7, instead of D6.

01-13-2011
  Putting out the first (alpha) release for Drupal 7

01-07-2011
  Working from the 6x-1.4 version of Arrange Fields to try and create
  a port for D7.
